## Project
We were tasked with cloning the appearance of well known website. I chose wikipedia.

## How did it go?
* Gradient borderes were new to me, and I don't find the syntax for them intuitive yet
* This was my first time using grid, rather than flex styling.
* Overall, I'm happy with my use of gradients here.

## What would I improve next time round?
* I would have used a table, rather than an unordered list, for the infobox on the right of the screen. (This is how the original page does it)
* Though grid worked fine for recreating my original screen-grab, flexbox would have been more efficient for making reactive layouts.
* I would add flexbox styling to the topNav bar, and replaced "---------" and "search bar" with a blank tab and a white div, respectively.
